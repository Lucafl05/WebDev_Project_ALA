Website Prototype Description 

Hi Lucas, 
 
Thanks for your email. We have prepared a description of the prototype website. We are also more than happy to implement three features to cater for you and others who are visually impaired. 

Prototype Breakdown 

Header: At the very top, there’s a navigation area on the left and a “shop link” on the right. 

 

Landing Page Title: This section includes a large title placeholder and a short description of “Lucas’s snow.” To the right of this text, there’s space reserved for an image. 

 

Adventures Section: Titled “Adventures,” it has a short description of his adventures on the left and another image placeholder on the right. 

 

How We Work: This section includes a title and a box labelled “Details” underneath. 

 

Customer Reviews: A large box is reserved here, likely for testimonials or feedback. 

 

Our Team: This section has the title “Our team” and three circular placeholders, probably for team member photos or bios. 

 

Footer: At the bottom, there’s a placeholder labelled “Footer goes here.” 

It’s a clean, structured layout with clear sections for content, images, and navigation. Let me know if there’s anything specific, you’d like me to focus on or if there are updates to the design. 
 
Thanks again, 
ALA Team
