Hi Lucas, 

We’re excited to share the low-fidelity wireframe for the Community Landing Page. We’ve designed it with a clear and engaging structure that introduces your story, showcases your adventures, and builds trust with your audience. 

What’s Included: 

Header: A simple navigation area with space for key links, including a shop link. 

Landing Section: A title and short description of your snow adventures, paired with a visual to set the tone. 

Adventures Section: A brief overview of your experiences, supported by imagery to bring the stories to life. 

How We Work: A section to explain your process, followed by a dedicated Details area for deeper insight. 

Customer Reviews: A space for testimonials to highlight real feedback and build credibility. 

Our Team: Featuring three visual placeholders to introduce your team members and add a personal touch. 

Footer: Reserved for essential links and contact information. 

Why We Made These Choices: 

We wanted the page to feel intuitive and welcoming. The flow moves naturally from introduction to storytelling, then into trust-building and team connection. Each section is modular, so it can evolve with your needs. 

Let us know what resonates with you and what you'd like to adjust or explore further. We’re happy to collaborate and refine this to make sure it reflects your vision perfectly. 

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 

Warm regards, 
ALA Team.
